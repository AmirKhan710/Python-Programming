# Python-Programming
Python programming serves as a powerful bridge between complex back-end logic and user-friendly front-end interfaces. My development focus spans from mastering fundamental syntax and control structures to building interactive desktop applications using the Tkinter framework. These projects emphasize event-driven programming, ensuring that computational scripts are both functional and accessible to the end user
# Python Foundations & GUI Development

## 📌 About the Repository
This repository documents my development journey in Python, ranging from fundamental logic scripts to functional Desktop Applications. As a **BSc Computer Science student**, I use this space to apply Python to real-world problems, focusing on clean code and user-friendly interfaces.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **/gui-applications**: Graphical interfaces built with **Tkinter**, focusing on event-driven programming.
- **/core-programming**: Fundamental scripts covering loops, data structures, and algorithms.
- **/file-management**: Projects involving file handling, data persistence, and byte manipulation.
- **/assignments**: Laboratory work and practical solutions for my BSc coursework.

## 🛠️ Technical Competencies
- **GUI Design:** Creating interactive windows, widgets, and event handlers using Tkinter.
- **Data Logic:** Working with complex lists, dictionaries, and conditional branching.
- **File I/O:** Reading, writing, and managing external data files.
- **Problem Solving:** Implementing the **Kaizen 1% rule** approach to code optimization and modular design.
